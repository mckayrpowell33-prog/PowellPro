# Powell Projects – AI Operations Website

## Repo summary (150 words max)
This repository contains a complete, static marketing website for an AI Operations consultancy. The site is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so it can be deployed directly to GitHub Pages without build tools. It includes dedicated pages for services, pricing, case studies, FAQs, and legal policies, plus a contact flow with a Formspree-ready form and booking link. All assets are local, including a Boise skyline SVG hero background, a roofline chart logo mark, and a lightweight SVG favicon. Copy is written for small businesses, real estate professionals, and local service providers who want practical AI workflows that save time.
